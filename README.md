## üìå Background & Overview

**Objective:**

**üìñ What is this project about?**

This project aims to build a **Power BI dashboard** using the *Global Superstore Sales* dataset, which includes data on 3 tables: (**Orders**), (**People**) and (**Returns**).
The goal is to provide senior managers and stakeholders with **data-driven insights** to:

- **Understand current business performance**
 
- ** market expansion strategies**

- **Identify strategic products for growth**

- **Support better decision-making to drive revenue and ROI**


**üë§ Who is this project for?**

‚úîÔ∏è Data analysts & business analysts seeking actionable insights.

‚úîÔ∏è Marketing and sales teams focusing on product performance and market growth.

‚úîÔ∏è Route to Product team aiming to improve product quality via return product.


**‚ùìBusiness Questions:**

‚úîÔ∏è What is the current performance of Superstore?

‚úîÔ∏è Which markets should Superstore expand into to increase revenue and ROI?

‚úîÔ∏è Which products should be prioritized for strategic growth and should we improve the quality of most returned product?


**üéØProject Outcome:**

- Revenue increased significantly, but profit margin remained flat, indicating rising costs and limited operational efficiency gains.  
- Canada emerged as a high-margin market (28%) despite low revenue, while Africa and EMEA showed the fastest YoY growth, revealing expansion potential.  
- Oceania and Africa attracted the most new customers, whereas most revenue still came from loyal, returning buyers.  
- Technology led revenue growth and profitability, but return rates in some tech SKUs (e.g., Cisco, Motorola) impacted margins.  
- Products like Copiers delivered the highest profit per unit, while low-performing items (e.g., Suppliers, Furnishings) diluted overall profitability.

By aligning regional and product strategies, senior managers can **scale in high-margin markets**, **invest in scalable profitable categories**, and **optimize acquisition and return management**, driving **sustainable long-term growth**.

- **Profit Margin % trend:** Peaked in 2013 (12.0%), dropped slightly in 2014 (~11.5%).  
- Insight: Growth in 2014 was driven more by volume than by margin.

---

## By Market & Category
- **EU:** High sales and highest profit margin. Large share of Technology products (good margins).  
- **APAC:** Second highest sales, mid-to-high margin; room to optimize margins, especially in Furniture and Office Supplies.  
- **LATAM:** Medium sales, margins are stable but not outstanding.

- **EMEA:** Lowest sales and margin (~5%); possible pricing, cost, or discounting issues.

---

## Order Count by Country
- Large clusters in **North America**, **Europe**, **Australia**.  
- Scattered orders in **Africa** and **Indian Ocean** regions.  
- Order count does not equal revenue; some regions may have many small-value orders.

### üìå Key Findings:

# Strategic Dashboard Analysis

## Top Highest Sub-Category (by Total Sales)
1. **Phones:** 1.4M  
2. **Copiers:** 1.2M  
3. **Chairs:** 1.2M   

**Insight:** Phones dominate in sales volume, followed by high-value office and furniture items. Top 4 sub-categories contribute a significant portion of total sales.

---

## Total Profit by Person and Category
- **Top performer:** Anna Andrews ‚Äî strong profit, especially in Furniture and Technology.
- Jack Lebron and Shirley Daniels follow as key contributors.
- Remaining sales reps have noticeably lower profit generation.
- Technology and Furniture appear in top contributors‚Äô portfolios, suggesting high-margin opportunities.

---

## Yearly Sales & Profit Performance
**Trends:**
- Steady growth in sales and profit from 2011 to 2014.
- Highest jump in both sales and profit between 2012 and 2013.
- Return count increases over time, possibly linked to higher sales volume.

---

## Yearly Trends (Chart: Total Sales, Total Profit, Sales YoY Growth %)
- **Strong growth** in 2013 (~30% YoY), followed by slightly slower growth in 2014.
- Total profit tracks closely with sales growth.
- Momentum maintained, but YoY growth rate peaked in 2013 and declined in 2014.

---

## Key Insights
1. **Phones, Copiers, and Chairs** are key sales drivers; optimizing inventory, pricing, and promotion in these areas could yield significant gains.
2. **Top sales reps** (especially Anna Andrews) contribute a disproportionate share of profits ‚Äî their sales approach could be analyzed and replicated.
3. **Return counts** increase alongside sales; worth investigating if high-return sub-categories overlap with top-selling items.
4. **2013 peak YoY growth** indicates a strong year; identifying the market or campaign drivers from that year could inform future strategies.
5. Maintaining growth in 2014 required higher sales volume but achieved with a lower growth rate compared to 2013.

### üìå Key Findings:

# Return Product Analysis Dashboard 


## Most Returned Products (by Return Value)
1. **Samsung Smart ‚Ä¶** ‚Äî 17K  
2. **HP Wireless Fax ‚Ä¶** ‚Äî 6K  
3. **Safco Classic Bookcase ‚Ä¶** ‚Äî 5K  

**Insight:** Samsung Smart product line is a major outlier with return value far exceeding other items. Electronics dominate the top return list, suggesting potential product quality, compatibility, or customer expectation issues.

---

## Return Count and Return Rate % by Year
- **2011 ‚Üí 2012:** Increase in both return count and rate.  
- **2012:** Peak return rate (~5.2%).  
- **2013 ‚Üí 2014:** Return rate decreases slightly, even though return counts remain high.  
- Indicates possible improvement in return management processes while sales volumes grew.

---

## Order Count and Return Count by Market
- **Highest orders:** EU and LATAM.  
- **Return counts** are also highest in EU and LATAM.  
- **Lowest orders:** APAC, but still records returns, indicating that returns are not solely volume-driven.

---

## Key Insights
1. **High-return products** are largely electronics, especially Samsung Smart devices. Root causes should be investigated (e.g., defect rates, customer dissatisfaction, misleading product descriptions).  
2. **EU and LATAM** have both the highest orders and returns ‚Äî focus on targeted return reduction strategies in these markets.  
3. **Return rate improvements** after 2012 suggest positive changes in quality control, supplier selection, or product information clarity.  
4. Tracking **return value impact** is essential: reducing top product returns could significantly increase net profit.


## üîé Final Conclusion & Recommendation 

## Conclusion
The business shows **consistent growth** in sales and profit from 2011 to 2014, driven primarily by **high-performing markets (EU, APAC)** and **top sub-categories (Phones, Copiers, Chairs, Bookcases)**.  
While profit margins have remained healthy, the slight drop in 2014 indicates that recent growth has been **volume-driven** rather than margin-led.  
**Returns remain a notable challenge**, particularly in high-value electronics, with EU and LATAM contributing the most to total returns.  
Top-performing sales representatives have significantly influenced profitability, but performance disparity across the team suggests potential untapped revenue opportunities.
